        <p class="article-paragraph">I joined a startup after graduating from college to learn as much as I could about
          starting my own
          company. I became a sort of Swiss Army knife with a variety of skills in research, sales, product
          development, and marketing. However, I always felt that I could leverage my growing expertise
          exponentially with a computer science degree.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">So, while working, I tried to learn how to program. It was hard to wrap my head
          around at first, but the
          more I learned, the more I realized what was possible - motivating me to learn more.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">Eventually, I automated a few of my work tasks with little bits of Python code.
          With one script, I could
          create a Google slides presentation for use in livestreams that included the most recent stock price
          data. With another, I could generate performance reports from our Mailchimp campaigns to track email
          marketing goals.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">I was amazed at how many different ways I could apply code. Those short scripts
          saved time for my
          colleagues and me, allowing us to accomplish more. Our team of just a couple of people suddenly felt
          much larger.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">After that startup was acquired by a cryptocurrency company, our team was
          dismantled due to industry-wide
          layoffs. This was a blessing in disguise, however, as now I could devote more time to my burgeoning
          interest in programming. The scripts I’d written worked, but they were hacky. If I was going to build a
          company, I needed a strong technological foundation.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">What I knew was from watching YouTube videos and reading Stack Overflow - I was
          missing the fundamentals.
          So I signed up for a free online course meant for first-year computer science students. It covered a
          wide range of topics from a very high level, piquing my interest further. I needed more, but there were
          so many unknown unknowns that I didn’t know where to go next.</p>

        <p class="article-paragraph">Someday I will start my own company. After learning on my own for months, tending a
          passion
          for technology, I am now a proud member of <a href="https://devdegree.ca/" class="hover:text-green-600">Dev Degree</a>, Shopify's work / study co-op.</p>
