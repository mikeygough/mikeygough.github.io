                i picked up my first programming knowledge in college which led to a rewarding role as a derivatives
                researcher at tastytrade. i worked mostly in jupyterlab writing python code.

                as i transitioned to small exchange i found myself drawn to automating workflows by writing code that
                connected tools like google sheets, slides, snowflake, and mailchimp - saving hours for my team and me.

                the small victories drove me to delve deeper into programming so when my journey with small exchange
                concluded i decided to immerse myself in computer science fundamentals from harvard's cs50 program. my
                final projects for cs50x, cs50p and cs50w
                exist on my github.

                what excites me most about programming is its boundless ability to bring ideas to life. someday, i hope
                to build something the whole world
                can benefit from.
