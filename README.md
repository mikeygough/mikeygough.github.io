### development notes:

#### converting to a react app:

right now this site is pretty crude. just plain html & some weakly loaded tailwind styles. i dont think the content is half bad but there's a lot of duplication since i'm not using any kind of templates to share content across html pages. if i convert this over to a react app then i can componentize everything, add react router, and make it more playful

#### adding portfolio section

as mentioned above, the content here isn't so bad but it'd be nice to showcase some projects (coffee-hunter might be the only project i'm really _proud_ of).

#### incorporate blog?
