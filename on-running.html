            <p>Sometime during my senior year of college, a friend challenged me to run a half-marathon. As someone who
                enjoys new experiences and a little competition, I accepted, exercised for a few grueling weeks and
                finished the first of what would turn out to be a whole career of races.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Eager for another challenge, I picked up a book about people who run 100-mile marathons. “That’s
                impossible,” I thought, but I was intrigued and felt that if I could run a hundred miles then I could do
                anything.</p>

            <br>

            <p>First, I needed a plan to lean against and hold myself accountable. So, I signed up for my first full
                marathon, found a training guide online and pinned it to my wall.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Every morning when I woke up and every evening before I fell asleep I'd look at that plan. After each run
                I'd draw a thick sharpie line through that day. It was this constant reminder to shape up that gave me
                motivation as the thick sharpie strikes crossed out more and more days.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Eighteen weeks later, having completed 72% of my training plan, I ran my first marathon. The difficulty
                of this stage in my journey caused me to think about how a 100-miler was roughly equivalent to running
                four marathons in a row and I almost gave up. Instead, I signed up for another race and kept going.</p>

            <br>

            <p>All in, I prepared for nearly four years - 850 total hours spent running more than 5,500 training miles.
                When race day finally came, it took me almost thirty hours to finish. And while I may have walked the
                last ten miles, I did it.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I used a paper training plan for every race I ran, all of which I still have. They helped me stay
                disciplined by reminding me what I wanted to achieve and how far I had come. I worked a full-time job
                but found time to run. I went out with friends, but only after finishing my run and always while
                thinking about the next day’s run. I learned that when you want something, you find time for it because
                consistency is the key to growth.</p>
