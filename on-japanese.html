      <p>Falling in love with someone from the other side of the world is beautiful and sometimes messy. Cultural
        friction pops up in the most surprisingly delightful ways. That’s why, in an effort to learn more about
        my partner's background, I decided to learn the Japanese language.</p>

      <br>

      <p>A lifetime of optimism blinded me from seeing how hard it would be. The U.S. Department of State, which
        cultivates diplomats, ranks it as one of the most difficult languages to learn, bestowing it the
        hilariously accurate ‘super-hard languages’ title.</p>

      <br>

      <p>I set a goal to pass the coveted Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) within twelve months. In my
        mind, passing the JLPT was a better goal than simply ‘learn Japanese’ because it included a deadline,
        clear curriculum and binary outcome.</p>

      <br>
      <p>There was so much to learn that I didn’t know where to start, so I dove in head-first.</p>

      <br>
      <p>I studied every single day: flashcards for new words, textbooks for grammar, music and anime for
        listening and children’s books for reading. At first, nothing made sense - it was a constant stream of
        frustration and failure.</p>

      <br>
      <p>But I powered through and eventually the picture became clearer. I could pick out certain words from a
        conversation; I began to recognize characters from what I was reading; and I was able to infer meaning
        with just a few perceivable context clues.</p>

      <br>

      <p>After hundreds of study hours, however, I still failed the JLPT. But the feelings of disappointment and
        heavy dose of humility were not enough to shake me from my path.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Failing that test gave me important feedback. I actually passed the vocabulary and listening sections! I
        was making progress and developed a consistent study routine. Now I had a better idea of my strengths
        and weaknesses and could adjust my strategy.</p>

      <br>

      <p>I know more Japanese today than I ever have, and I’ve discovered that I’ll continue to get better as long
        as I keep moving forward. Sure, it would have been nice to pick up this new skill with ease, but I
        cannot expect to be a natural at everything. Learning is a lifelong journey and failure is a requisite
        for growth that can only be overcome with resiliency.</p>
