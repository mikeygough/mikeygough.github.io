            Falling in love with someone from the other side of the
            world is beautiful and sometimes messy. Cultural friction
            pops up in the most surprisingly delightful ways.
            That&#39;s why, in an effort to learn more about my
            partner's background, I decided to learn the Japanese
            language.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            A lifetime of optimism blinded me from seeing how hard it
            would be. The U.S. Department of State, which cultivates
            diplomats, ranks it as one of the most difficult languages
            to learn, bestowing it the hilariously accurate
            <i>&#39;super-hard languages&#39;</i> title.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I set a goal to pass the coveted
            <abbr title="Japanese-Language Proficiency Test"
              >(JLPT)</abbr
            >
            within twelve months. In my mind, passing the JLPT was a
            better goal than simply
            <i>&#39;learn Japanese&#39;</i> because it included a
            deadline, clear curriculum and binary outcome.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            <em
              >There was so much to learn that I didn&#39;t know where
              to start, so I dove in head-first</em
            >.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I studied every single day: flashcards for new words,
            textbooks for grammar, music and anime for listening and
            children&#39;s books for reading. At first, nothing made
            sense - it was a constant stream of frustration and
            failure.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            But I powered through and eventually the picture became
            clearer. I could pick out certain words from a
            conversation; I began to recognize characters from what I
            was reading; and I was able to infer meaning with just a
            few perceivable context clues.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            After hundreds of study hours, however, I still failed the
            JLPT. But the feelings of disappointment and heavy dose of
            humility were not enough to shake me from my path.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Failing that test gave me important feedback. I actually
            passed the vocabulary and listening sections! I was making
            progress and developed a consistent study routine. Now I
            had a better idea of my strengths and weaknesses and could
            adjust my strategy.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I know more Japanese today than I ever have, and I&#39;ve
            discovered that I&#39;ll continue to get better as long as
            I keep moving forward. Sure, it would have been nice to
            pick up this new skill with ease, but I cannot expect to
            be a natural at everything. Learning is a lifelong journey
            and failure is a requisite for growth that can only be
            overcome with resiliency.
